# Dynamic Pricing for Urban Parking Lots

## üöó Background and Motivation

Urban parking spaces are a scarce and highly demanded resource. Static pricing often leads to inefficiencies‚Äîeither overcrowding or underutilization. To maximize utilization, dynamic pricing that adapts to real-time demand, competition, and environmental factors is essential.

This project simulates such a system. It builds an intelligent, data-driven pricing engine for 14 parking spaces using real-time data streams, economic theory, and machine learning models built from scratch (using only `numpy` and `pandas`). The code is designed for real-time streaming with [Pathway](https://pathway.com/) and visualization with [Bokeh](https://bokeh.org/).

## üóÇÔ∏è Data Description

The dataset covers 14 urban parking spaces over 73 days, sampled 18 times per day (every 30 minutes from 8:00 AM to 4:30 PM).  
Each record includes:

- **Location Information**
  - Latitude and Longitude (for proximity/competition calculations)

- **Parking Lot Features**
  - Capacity (maximum vehicles)
  - Occupancy (current vehicles)
  - Queue length (vehicles waiting)

- **Vehicle Information**
  - Incoming vehicle type: `car`, `bike`, or `truck`

- **Environmental Conditions**
  - Nearby traffic congestion level
  - Special day indicator (holidays, events)

## üéØ Project Objective

Build a dynamic pricing model for each parking lot such that:

- Price updates in real time based on:
  - Historical occupancy patterns
  - Queue length
  - Nearby traffic
  - Special events
  - Vehicle type
  - Competitor prices
- Starts from a base price of $10
- Price variation is smooth and explainable
- (Optional) Suggests rerouting vehicles if a lot is overburdened

## üìà Model Stages

### **Model 1: Baseline Linear Model**

- Linear price increase as occupancy increases  
  `Price_{t+1} = Price_t + Œ± * (Occupancy / Capacity)`

### **Model 2: Demand-Based Price Function**

- Demand function considers occupancy, queue, traffic, special days, and vehicle type  
  Example:  
  `Demand = Œ±*(Occupancy/Capacity) + Œ≤*QueueLength ‚àí Œ≥*Traffic + Œ¥*IsSpecialDay + Œµ*VehicleTypeWeight`  
  `Price_t = BasePrice * (1 + Œª * NormalizedDemand)`  
- Demand is normalized, and price is bounded (0.5x to 2x of base)

### **Model 3: Competitive Pricing Model (Optional)**

- Adds location intelligence and competition:
  - Uses geographic proximity to find competitors
  - Factors in competitor prices
  - If full & competitors are cheaper ‚Üí suggest reroute or reduce price
  - If competitors are more expensive ‚Üí can increase price
